This repository contains the Homework assignments and experiments carried out for the Machine Learning subject, at Illinois Institute of Technology for the Master´s degree in Computational Decision Science & Operations Research.

This subject provides its students with a solid understanding on the fundamentals of Machine Learning: Gradient Descent, optimizers, Computer Vision, NLP, Encoder-Decoder architectures... to be used on advanced Artificial Intelligent applications, and to set the basis for the next step: Deep Learning.

📁 ***_Computer Vision Project: Mice Gravity Center detection***

---

This project uses AI architectures in order to be able to detect mice´s Gravity Center (GC) by using the location X-Y coordinates of various body parts as input: NOSE, LEFT_TEAR, RIGHT_TEAR, LEFT_HIP, RIGHT_HIP, TAIL_BASE and TAIL_END.
