This repository contains the Homework assignments and experiments carried out for the Machine Learning subject, at Illinois Institute of Technology for the Master¬¥s degree in Computational Decision Science & Operations Research.

This subject provides its students with a solid understanding on the fundamentals of Machine Learning: Gradient Descent, optimizers, Computer Vision, NLP, Encoder-Decoder architectures... to be used on advanced Artificial Intelligent applications, and to set the basis for the next step: Deep Learning.

üìÅ ***_Computer Vision Project: Mice Gravity Center detection***

---

This project uses AI architectures in order to be able to detect mice¬¥s Gravity Center (GC) by using the location X-Y coordinates of various body parts as input: NOSE, LEFT_TEAR, RIGHT_TEAR, LEFT_HIP, RIGHT_HIP, TAIL_BASE and TAIL_END.

üìÅ ***_Sequential Prediction Project: Apple Stock Prediction_***

---

* This project intends to build different Recurrent models in order to predict APPLE STOCK price based on the historic timeseries stock price. 
* Different Recurrent architectures are compared in terms of performance, complexity and runtime: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM NN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
* Additionally, non-Machine Learning based predictive statistical techniques are also used in order to compare and assess the importance of Machine Learning in order to learn from features, rather than performing basic statistical analysis with: ARIMA, and different Window-sized Simple Moving Averages (SMA)...
